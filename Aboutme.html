<h1>About me</h1>
	<img id="Vini" src="images/Vini.JPG" alt="Picture of Vinicius">
	<br>
	<p> I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro where I lived for 10 years and graduated in Architecture and Urbanism at Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro. While in Rio, I worked for five years in Architectural Design and Planning Permission on a variety of projects:<br>
	<ul id="project-type">
		<li>residential</li>
		<li>commercial</li>
		<li>industrial</li>
		<li>institutional for public and private sectors</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My last position in Brazil was as a full time Architect at Silvia Fernandes but in ordre to invest in my studies and to improve my command of the English language and took on an international exchange programme and moved to Ireland in 2015.
	During my language exchange program, I have worked in Dublin as a General Operative and also in Sales/Retail as a Stock Assistant in a very busy retail store.
	<br>
	After finishing my English studies, I completed a 6 month internship/freelancing opportunity with an Architectural firm in Dublin and gained my first experience working with architectural projects in Ireland.
	Currently I am looking for a new opportunity and more experience in the Irish Architectural sector.
	<br>
	I love everything about architecture, art and design. Apart from all of this, I'm passionate about drawings and paintings.
	</p>
	<h3>Love for Irish Architecture</h3>
	<p>The architecture of the Republic of Ireland is one of the most visible features in the Irish countryside â€“ with remains from all eras since the Stone Age
	abounding. Ireland is famous for its ruined and intact Norman and Anglo-Irish castles, small whitewashed thatched cottages and Georgian urban buildings. 
	What are unaccountably somewhat less famous are the still complete Palladian and rococo country houses which can be favourably compared to anything similar
	in northern Europe, and the country's many Gothic and neo-Gothic cathedrals and buildings. Despite the ofttimes significant British and European influence,
	the fashion and trends of architecture have been adapted to suit the peculiarities of the particular location. In the late 20th century a new economic 
	climate resulted in a renaissance of Irish culture and design, placing some of Ireland's cities, once again, at the cutting edge of modern architecture.
